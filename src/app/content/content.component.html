  Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
  Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
  Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
  Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
  Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
  Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
  Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element
